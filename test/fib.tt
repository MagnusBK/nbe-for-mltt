; Not really a particularly interesting program, but good for computing stuff.

let plus : Nat -> Nat -> Nat =
  fun m ->
  fun n ->
  rec n at x -> Nat with
  | zero -> m
  | suc _, p -> suc p

let fib : Nat -> Nat =
  fun n ->
  let worker : Nat * Nat =
    rec n at _ -> Nat * Nat with
    | zero -> <1, 0>
    | suc _, p -> <plus (fst p) (snd p), fst p> in
  snd worker

normalize fib 25 at Nat
